= Installation and Uninstallation Guide

== Overview

This document explains how to install and uninstall the software by adding or removing the program's `bin` folder to/from your user PATH environment variable on Windows.

The process is done via two VBScript files:  
- `install.vbs` — adds the `bin` folder to your PATH  
- `uninstall.vbs` — removes the `bin` folder from your PATH

After installation, you can run the program’s commands from any Command Prompt or PowerShell window.

== Installation

To install the software, run the installation script:

[source,batch]
----
cscript //nologo install.vbs
----

**What happens:**

- The script detects the `bin` folder located next to the script.  
- It adds this folder to your user PATH if it is not already present.  
- Shows a message confirming the successful installation or that the path already exists.

**Important notes:**

- Only your current user’s PATH is modified; system-wide PATH remains unchanged.  
- Administrator privileges are not required.  
- You need to restart your command prompt, PowerShell, or log off and log back in for the changes to take effect.  
- The script does **not** copy or install any files — make sure the `bin` folder and executables exist where expected.

== Uninstallation

To uninstall, run the uninstall script:

[source,batch]
----
cscript //nologo uninstall.vbs
----

**What happens:**

- The script removes the previously added `bin` folder from your user PATH.  
- Shows a message confirming the removal or indicating if the path was not found.

**Important notes:**

- This only affects your user account’s PATH variable.  
- After uninstallation, you won’t be able to run the commands globally unless you add the path again or run executables directly.

== Manual PATH Modification

If the VBScript files fail to run (for example, due to system restrictions on running scripts), you can modify the PATH variable manually:

1. **Find the `bin` folder:**  
   Locate the folder containing the program’s executables (`bin`), typically inside the installation directory.

2. **Add `bin` folder to PATH manually:**  
   - Open the Start Menu and search for “Environment Variables” and choose “Edit the system environment variables”.  
   - In the System Properties window, click on “Environment Variables...”.  
   - Under **User variables**, select the `Path` variable and click **Edit**.  
   - Click **New** and enter the full absolute path to the `bin` folder.  
   - Click **OK** to save all dialogs.  
   - Restart any open terminals or log out and back in to apply changes.

3. **Remove `bin` folder from PATH manually:**  
   - Repeat the steps above to open the PATH editor.  
   - Select the entry for the `bin` folder and click **Delete**.  
   - Save and restart terminals.

== Changing Installation Location

If you want to move the software to a different folder or drive:

- Move or copy the entire folder containing `bin` to the new location.  
- Remove the old `bin` path from your PATH (using uninstall script or manually).  
- Add the new `bin` path to your PATH (using install script or manually).  
- Restart your terminal or log off and back on.

**Note:** The VBScript scripts expect the `bin` folder to be next to them. If you move folders, running existing scripts will not correctly update the PATH.

== Troubleshooting & Tips

- **No admin rights needed:** The scripts modify only your user PATH, no administrator privileges are required.  
- **Script execution blocked:** If `.vbs` scripts do not run, check if Windows Script Host is enabled or run scripts as Administrator.  
- **Commands not recognized:**  
  - Restart your terminal after installing.  
  - Check the PATH variable with `echo %PATH%`.  
  - Confirm executables exist in the `bin` folder.  
- **Multiple versions:** Be careful if you have multiple installs; PATH order affects which version runs.  
- **Run scripts in PowerShell:**  
  Use the same command:  
  `cscript //nologo install.vbs`  
- **Editing scripts:** You can customize paths or behavior by editing the `.vbs` files if needed.
