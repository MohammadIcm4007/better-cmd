== Option Details

.**`-a` (Change access time only)**  
Update only the access time of the file, leaving modification time unchanged.

.**`-m` (Change modification time only)**  
Update only the modification time of the file, leaving access time unchanged.

.**`-c` (Do not create files)**  
If a file does not exist, do not create it. Skip such files silently with a warning.

.**`-t [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss]` (Specify timestamp)**  
Use the given timestamp instead of the current system time.  
The format supports:  
- `[[CC]YY]` century and year (optional)  
- `MM` month (01-12)  
- `DD` day (01-31)  
- `hh` hour (00-23)  
- `mm` minute (00-59)  
- Optional `.ss` seconds (00-59)  

Example:  
- `202306051230.45` means June 5, 2023, 12:30:45  
- `2306051230` means June 5, 2023, 12:30 (seconds default to 0)

== Usage Examples

[source,bash]
----
touch file.txt
touch -a file.txt
touch -m file.txt
touch -c file.txt
touch -t 202306051230.45 file.txt
touch -a -t 2306051230 file1.txt file2.txt
----

== Behavior and Error Reporting

- If the file does not exist and `-c` is not specified, the file is created empty.
- Errors such as failure to create or update file timestamps are reported in red text to stderr.
- Returns exit code 0 on success, non-zero if any error occurs.

== Implementation Notes

- On Windows, uses WinAPI functions (`CreateFileA`, `GetFileTime`, `SetFileTime`) to manipulate file times.
- Supports UTF-8 console output with ANSI color codes.
- Parses timestamp string with flexible support for century and seconds.
- Prints success and error messages with color for clarity.
- Supports multiple files as arguments.
