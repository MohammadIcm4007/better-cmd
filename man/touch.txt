NAME
    touch - create an empty file or update file timestamps

SYNOPSIS
    touch <file1> [file2 ...]

DESCRIPTION
    The touch program creates new empty files or updates the last access and modification timestamps of existing files.
    If a specified file does not exist, it will be created as an empty file.
    If the file exists, its timestamps are updated to the current system time.

    The program supports multiple files as arguments and processes each in order.
    It sets the Windows console to UTF-8 mode and enables virtual terminal processing to support colored output.

ERRORS
    If no file operand is provided, the program prints an error message and exits with status 1.
    If a file cannot be created or its timestamps cannot be updated, an error message is printed for that file.
    The program returns a non-zero exit status if any errors occur.

EXAMPLES
    - Create a new empty file or update timestamps of an existing file:
        touch file.txt

    - Create or update multiple files:
        touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
