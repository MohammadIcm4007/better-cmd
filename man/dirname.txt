NAME
    dirname - print the directory portion of a given path

SYNOPSIS
    dirname <path>

DESCRIPTION
    The dirname program extracts and prints the directory part of a given file path.
    It removes the last component (the base name) from the path, leaving the directory path.
    Trailing path separators ('/' on Unix-like systems or '\\' on Windows) are removed before processing.
    If the path contains no directory component, it prints '.' indicating the current directory.
    If the path consists entirely of slashes, it prints a single slash '/'.
    If the path is empty, it prints '.'.

    The program supports both Unix-style ('/') and Windows-style ('\\') path separators,
    determined at compile time by the platform.

ERRORS
    If no operand (path) is provided, the program prints an error message and exits with status 1.
    If memory allocation fails, it prints an error message and exits with status 1.

EXAMPLES
    - Extract directory part from a Unix-style path:
        ./dirname /usr/local/bin/script.sh
        Output: /usr/local/bin

    - Extract directory part from a Windows-style path:
        ./dirname C:\Program Files\App\app.exe
        Output: C:\Program Files\App

    - Handle path with trailing slashes:
        ./dirname /home/user/docs/
        Output: /home/user

    - Handle path with no directory component:
        ./dirname filename.txt
        Output: .
