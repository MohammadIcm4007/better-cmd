NAME
    chdir - Change the current directory

SYNOPSIS
    chdir [/d] [<drive>:][<path>]
    chdir [..]

DESCRIPTION
    The chdir command displays the current directory or changes the current directory in the command prompt.
    If used without parameters, it shows the current drive and directory.
    When used with a path, it changes the working directory to the specified path.
    The /d option changes both the current drive and directory.
    Using only a drive letter (e.g., chdir C:) displays the current directory on that drive without changing the active drive.
    The command is equivalent to cd.
