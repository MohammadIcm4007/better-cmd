NAME
    env - display the list of environment variables

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
    The env program displays the current environment variables with their values.
    Each variable is printed in the format "KEY : VALUE", where KEY is the name of the environment variable,
    and VALUE is its corresponding value.

    The output is formatted to align the keys for better readability.
    Memory is dynamically allocated to store the keys, and freed before the program exits.
