NAME
    cd - change the current directory or display the current directory

SYNOPSIS
    cd [/d] [<drive>:][<path>]
    cd [..]

DESCRIPTION
    The cd command displays the current directory or changes the current directory in the command prompt.
    If used without parameters, it shows the current drive and directory.
    When used with a path, it changes the working directory to the specified path.
    The /d option changes both the current drive and directory.
    Using only a drive letter (e.g., cd C:) displays the current directory on that drive without changing the active drive.
    The command is equivalent to chdir.

    /?
        Displays help information.

EXAMPLES

        cd \

    - Change to a specific directory on the current drive:

    - Change to a directory on a different drive and switch to that drive:
        cd /d D:\Projects

    - Change to the parent directory:
