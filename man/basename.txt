NAME
    basename - print the base name of a given path

SYNOPSIS
    basename <path>

DESCRIPTION
    This program extracts and prints the base name (the last component) of a given file path.
    It removes any trailing path separators ('/' on Unix-like systems or '\\' on Windows) before extracting the base name.
    The base name is the final part of the path after the last path separator.

    If the input path ends with one or more path separators, they are stripped first.
    If the path is empty, it prints an empty line.
    The program supports both Unix-style ('/') and Windows-style ('\\') path separators,
    determined at compile time by the platform.

ERRORS
    If no operand (path) is provided, the program prints an error message and exits with status 1.
    If memory allocation fails, it prints an error message and exits with status 1.

EXAMPLES
    - Extract base name from a Unix-style path:
        ./basename /usr/local/bin/script.sh
        Output: script.sh

    - Extract base name from a Windows-style path:
        ./basename C:\Program Files\App\app.exe
        Output: app.exe

    - Handle trailing separators:
        ./basename /home/user/docs/
        Output: docs

SEE ALSO
    dirname - print the directory part of a path
