NAME
    pure - remove ANSI escape codes and emojis from input text

SYNOPSIS
    pure [file1 file2 ...]

DESCRIPTION
    The pure program reads text input from one or more files or standard input if no files are specified.
    It processes the input by removing all ANSI escape codes (used for coloring and terminal control)
    and all emojis encoded in UTF-8.
    The cleaned text is then written to standard output.

    This tool is useful for sanitizing terminal output or logs by stripping color codes and emojis,
    producing plain text output.

    When reading from files, each file is processed sequentially.
    When no files are provided, pure reads from standard input.

    The program sets the Windows console code page to UTF-8 to properly handle Unicode input and output.

ERRORS
    If a specified file cannot be opened, an error message is printed to standard error, and processing continues with the next file.
    If memory allocation fails during processing, the program prints an error message and exits with status 1.

EXAMPLES
    - Remove ANSI codes and emojis from a file:
        pure input.txt > output.txt

    - Remove ANSI codes and emojis from multiple files:
        pure file1.txt file2.txt > clean_output.txt

    - Remove ANSI codes and emojis from piped input:
        some_command | pure
