NAME
    tracert - trace the route to a network host

SYNOPSIS
    tracert [options] [hostname or IP address]

DESCRIPTION
    The tracert command traces the path that packets take from the local computer to a specified network host.
    It sends ICMP Echo Request packets with increasing TTL (Time To Live) values to discover each hop (router)
    along the route until reaching the destination or the maximum number of hops.
    This helps diagnose routing issues and identify where network delays or failures occur.

OPTIONS
    -d
        Do not resolve IP addresses to hostnames. This speeds up the trace by skipping DNS lookups.

    -h maximum_hops
        Set the maximum number of hops to search for the target. Default is 30.

    -w timeout
        Set the timeout in milliseconds to wait for each reply. Default is 4000 ms.

    -S srcaddr
        Specify the source address to use (IPv6 only).

    -4
        Force using IPv4.

    -6
        Force using IPv6.

EXAMPLES
    - Trace route to a hostname:
        tracert example.com

    - Trace route to an IP address:
        tracert 8.8.8.8

    - Trace route without resolving hostnames:
        tracert -d example.com

    - Trace route with a maximum of 20 hops:
        tracert -h 20 example.com

SEE ALSO
    ping - test network connectivity
    ipconfig - Display and manage IP configuration
    netstat - Display active TCP connections, listening ports, and more


NOTES
    If a hop does not respond, you may see "Request timed out" indicating that the router is not replying to ICMP packets.
    The trace continues until the destination is reached or the maximum hops are exceeded.
