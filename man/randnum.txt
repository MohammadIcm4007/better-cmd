NAME
    randnum - generate a random number between 0 and a specified maximum

SYNOPSIS
    randnum [max_number]

DESCRIPTION
    The randnum program generates and prints a random integer between 0 and the specified max_number (inclusive).
    If no max_number is provided, it defaults to 100.

    The program seeds the random number generator with the current time to produce different sequences on each run.

ERRORS
    If more than one argument is provided, the program prints a usage message and exits with status 1.
    If the max_number argument is not a positive integer, the program prints an error message and exits with status 1.

EXAMPLES
    - Generate a random number between 0 and 100 (default):
        randnum

    - Generate a random number between 0 and 50:
        randnum 50
