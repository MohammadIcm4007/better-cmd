NAME
    uniq - filter out duplicate lines from input

SYNOPSIS
    uniq [file]

DESCRIPTION
    The uniq program reads lines from the specified file or standard input if no file is given,
    and outputs only unique lines, removing any duplicate lines that have appeared before.
    It preserves the order of the first occurrence of each unique line.

    This implementation uses a hash table to track lines that have already been seen.

ERRORS
    If the specified file cannot be opened, an error message is printed and the program exits with status 1.
    If more than one argument is provided, the program prints a usage message and exits with status 1.

EXAMPLES
    - Filter duplicate lines from a file:
        uniq input.txt

    - Filter duplicate lines from standard input:
        some_command | uniq

SEE ALSO
    pure - remove ANSI escape codes and emojis from input text
